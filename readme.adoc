== Introduction

These are notes from the start up installation and configuration of the RPI400.


== Additional Software

=== Double commander

Dual pane file manager

 sudo apt-get install doublecmd-qt

After this install the Double commander should be in the `Accessories`

.Double Commander

=== Visual Studio Code

IDE and editor with great extension library

Reference: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/raspberry-pi

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install code

=== Arduino IDE

C++ IDE editor for ardunio based boards

Rference: https://www.raspberrypi-spy.co.uk/2020/12/install-arduino-ide-on-raspberry-pi/

NOTE: The install below results in the installation of Arduino IDE version 1.6. This is an extremely outdated version which makes it difficult to use or impossible to flash certain devices.

 sudo apt install arduino

Download current IDE from website https://www.arduino.cc/en/software

Linux Arm 64 bit, as rgw RPI400 project is 64 bt based.

Copy of `arduino-1.8.19-linuxaarch64.tar` is located link:/largefiles/arduino-1.8.19-linuxaarch64.tar[here]

Go to download and untar

  tar -xf arduino-1.8.19-linuxarm.tar.xz

Move the folder to the `opt` directory.

  sudo mv arduino-1.8.19 /opt

Run the script to install it

   sudo /opt/arduino-1.8.19/install.sh

The scrip will add and entry to the `Programming` tab for Arduino IDE.

== Chrome Extensions

=== ASCIIDoctor JS extension

This Chrome extension will allow viewing of an `*.adoc` file directly in the browser.

Reference: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/asciidoctorjs-live-previe/iaalpfgpbocpdfblpnhhgllgbdbchmia

.Crhome Store

The extension must be enabled to allow use of File URLS.

.Extension Setting

== Networking

=== VNC Server

The VNC server will allow for GUI remote access for Windows systems.

In RPI Terminal enter

  sudo raspi-config

Go to Interface options, then to VNC, then enable VNC server

.Verify VNC running

== Windows Mount RPI400 Share

Using Windows file explorer map a drive

.Map Drive
image::mapdrive.png[Map Drive, alt='Alt Tag', align='center']
 
The go to the proper RPI400 share

.SharedFolder

=== Mount Windows share

NOTE: The following section never worked!!!!
All I ever got was

----
 jschust2@RaspberryPI:~ $ sudo mount.cifs //10.1.10.22/Dropbox /home/jschust2/Dropbox/ -o user=jschust2,password=landsra9035
mount error(2): No such file or directory
Refer to the mount.cifs(8) manual page (e.g. man mount.cifs) and kernel log messages (dmesg)
jschust2@RaspberryPI:~ $ 
----

Reference: https://www.bitpi.co/2015/02/16/accessing-a-windows-share-with-a-raspberry-pi/

This will allow the Dropbox folder on the Windows desktop be available to the RPI400.

Verify using Windows `CMD` that Windows share is available using the following command.

  net share

The share must be listed here to use in on RPI.

.Verify Windows share
image::netshare.png[Veriy Windows share, alt='Alt Tag', align='center']
 
Verify the proper permissions exist

.Dropbox folder permissions
image::permissions.png[Dropbox folder permissions, alt='Alt Tag', align='center']
 
NOTE: Respect the RPI User name you logged in under.  In this case the login is `jschust2`  not `pi`

Using the RPI GUI Raspberry PI Configuration utility, Turn off the Auto login feature to avoid confusing `jschust2` and `pi`.  There were a lot of headaches here.

.RPI Auto Login

Install SAMBA and Utilities for SMB support.

 sudo apt-get install samba

 sudo apt-get install samba-common-bin 

We will need to install cifs-utils. This will help us mount SMB directories- which is what we get from Windows. We can install easily on Raspbian by running the following command:

  sudo apt-get install cifs-utils;  

Establish mount to a Windows share

Now we will create a mount point in the `mnt` directory:

  mkdir /mnt/Dropbox/

The mount command for the Dropbox folder on the desktop the newly created folder on the RPI400.


  sudo mount.cifs -o user=jschust2,password=****** //10.1.10.22/Dropbox /mnt/Dropbox 

NOTE: No space between user and password, all optional args are comma separated.

In order for your Raspberry Pi to mount the network shares on boot up, we need to modify the /etc/fstab file.

  
  

There may be entries there already. All we need to do is add the following to the end of the file:

  //10.1.10.22/Dropbox  /mnt/Dropbox  cifs username=jschust2,password=******,iocharset=utf8,sec=ntlm  0  0

Now we can manually run the same mount process at boot up from the command line by running:

  sudo mount -a;

restart the samba service so that it loads in our configuration changes.

  sudo systemctl restart smbd

NOTE: This Create-Doco script can work with Microsoft Visual Studio code.
There are a set of Command snippets for quickly entering blocks of ASCIIDoc code
using Ctrl-Space-z which call us a list of the ASCIIDOC 

A copy of those snippets are in the file (asciidoc.json)
